[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/7acd5aa8048a4c96bd97a96bac2639d1)](https://app.codacy.com/app/huang836/deep-learning-for-document-dewarping?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thomasjhuang/deep-learning-for-document-dewarping&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

#### Dependencies


#### Installation
To install the package above, pleae run:
```shell
pip install -r requiremnts
```

## Build Environment
- Include instructions of how to launch scripts in the build subfolder
- Build scripts can include shell scripts or python setup.py files
- The purpose of these scripts is to build a standalone environment, for running the code in this repository
- The environment can be for local use, or for use in a cloud environment
- If using for a cloud environment, commands could include CLI tools from a cloud provider (i.e. gsutil from Google Cloud Platform)
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Test
- Include instructions for how to run all tests after the software is installed
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Run Inference
- Include instructions on how to run inference
- i.e. image classification on a single image for a CNN deep learning project
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Build Model
- Include instructions of how to build the model
- This can be done either locally or on the cloud
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Serve Model
- Include instructions of how to set up a REST or RPC endpoint
- This is for running remote inference via a custom model
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Analysis
- Include some form of EDA (exploratory data analysis)
- And/or include benchmarking of the model and results
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```
